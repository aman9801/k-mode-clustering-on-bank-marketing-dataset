# k-mode-clustering-on-bank-marketing-dataset

### Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

### Analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook using these Python libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Kmodes, Matplotib and Seaborn
